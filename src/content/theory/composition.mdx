Composition vs Inheritance
People sometimes say “composition” when contrasting it with inheritance.
This has less to do with functions (which we’ve been discussing all along)
and more to do with objects and classes — that is, with traditional
object-oriented programming.

In particular, if you express your code as classes, it is tempting to reuse
behavior from another class by extending it (inheritance). However, this
makes it somewhat difficult to adjust the behavior later. For example, you
may want to similarly reuse behavior from another class, but you can’t
extend more than one base class.

Sometimes, people say that inheritance “locks you into” your first design
because the cost of changing the class hierarchy later is too high. When
people suggest composition is an alternative to inheritance, they mean that
instead of extending a class, you can keep an instance of that class as a field.
Then you can “delegate” to that instance when necessary, but you are also free
to do something different.

Function composition is a powerful concept, but it raises the level of abstraction
and makes your code less direct. If you write your code in a style that composes
functions in some way before calling them, and there are other humans on your team,
make sure that you’re getting concrete benefits from this approach. It is not “cleaner”
or “better”, and there is a price to pay for “beautiful” but indirect code.

```js filename="composition" copy
const dateFunc = () => new Date();
const textFunc = (date) => date.toDateString();
const labelFunc = (text) => `Today ${text}`;
const showLabelFunc = (label) => console.log(label);

const date = dateFunc();
const text = textFunc(date);
const label = labelFunc(text);
showLabelFunc(label); // Today Sat Sep 28 2024

function pipe(...steps) {
  return function runSteps() {
    let result;
    for (let i = 0; i < steps.length; i++) {
      let step = steps[i];
      result = step(result);
    }
    return result;
  };
}

const showDateLabel = pipe(dateFunc, textFunc, labelFunc, showLabelFunc);
showDateLabel(); // Today Sat Sep 28 2024
```

### inheritance

```typescript
// Base class
class Vehicle {
  private readonly _make: string;
  private readonly _model: string;
  private readonly _year: number;

  constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number) {
    this._make = make;
    this._model = model;
    this._year = year;
  }

  displayInfo(): string {
    return `${this._year} ${this._make} ${this._model}`;
  }
}

// Derived class
class Car extends Vehicle {
  private readonly _doors: number;

  constructor(
    make: string,
    model: string,
    year: number,
    doors: number,
  ) {
    super(make, model, year); // Call the constructor of the base class
    this._doors = doors;
  }

  displayInfo(): string {
    return `${super.displayInfo()} - ${this._doors} doors`;
  }
}

const vehicle = new Vehicle("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020);
console.log(vehicle.displayInfo()); // 2020 Toyota Corolla

const car = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2022, 4);
console.log(car.displayInfo()); // 2022 Honda Civic - 4 doors
```
