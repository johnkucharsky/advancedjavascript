# Advanced JavaScript Code Examples

## Getting Started

💡 Leetcode problems can sometimes feel disconnected from real-world development ( with a few valuable exceptions: **graph algorithms** and **system design** ).

What truly matters? Understanding how **JavaScript works under the hood**. If you don't understand JavaScript, Leetcode is just a waste of time —
you're solving abstract puzzles without mastering the real engine behind your code. Instead, build your skills with **Advanced JavaScript Patterns**,
carefully selected code snippets, and concepts that companies *actually* expect in interviews.

**Dive in, practice, and develop real confidence.**

> 📌 This resource complements foundational learning platforms like
> [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/), and [react.dev](https://react.dev).
> If you’re just starting out, begin there to build strong fundamentals.

## 🧭 Graph Algorithms

Fundamental graph traversal logic used in system design and coding challenges.

- `Graph Traversal` – **BFS**, **DFS**, adjacency lists, graph algorithms.

## 📦 JS Native

Deep dive into native JavaScript methods and behavior. Each section includes polyfills ( custom implementation ),
explanations and all possible use cases.

- `Map` – Map, WeakMap, Map.groupBy.
- `Mutating Methods` – concat, fill, pop, push, reverse, shift, unshift, splice.
- `Promises` – Promise.all, race, any, allSettled.
- `Read methods` – at, every, find, findIndex, findLast, includes, indexOf, some.
- `Set and Object` – Set, Object.groupBy, Object.assign, Array.entries.
- `Transform Methods` – filter, flat, flatMap, join, map, reduce, slice.

## 📖 Learn JS and Mdn

Essential learning topics pulled from MDN, Learn JS, interviews and my web dev job.

- `Advanced Patterns` – Memoize, Mixins, Promise Chaining, Promise Error Handling, Synchronous vs Asynchronous Errors in Promises, Proxy, Range Iterator, Shooters: Closures & Lexical Scope.
- `Delay, Throttling and Debounce` – Delay Decorator, Delaying function execution, Output Every Second, setInterval, setTimeout, throttling and debounce decorator.
- `Core Concepts` – Understanding this, Loop Behavior: Pre- / Post-Increment, Object and Map Conversion, bind, Async Generators, Fibonacci ( Iterative Approach, Recursive Approach ).
- `Event Loop` – Event Loop edge cases — the **#1 most asked JavaScript interview topic**.
- `This and Object Methods` – Nuances of `this` across different method contexts — the **#2 most asked JavaScript interview topic**.

## ⚙️ Lodash

Utility functions from [lodash](https://lodash.com/).

- `Chunk, Compact, Partition` – chunk, compact, partition.
- `Difference, Intersection, Union` – difference, differenceBy, intersection, union.
- `Object Utilities` – keyBy, omit, orderBy, pick, curry.

## ⚛️ React

React specific topics.

- `React Rendering` – usePrevious, children.
- `State Patterns` – Normalized State, useReducer ( custom implementation ).

## 🧩 System Design

System design concepts often seen in real interviews.

- `Redux and Twitter` – Redux reducer pattern, most used pattern for state management in react. Twitter feed pattern.
- `Queue and Stack` – Stacks and queues are core to how JavaScript works under the hood — and they show up in nearly every interview.

## 🧠 Theory

High-level principles and mental models.

- `Composition vs Inheritance` - Composition, Inheritance and Function Stack.
- `SOLID in React` - SOLID principles in React.
- `Type Conversions` - Explore the magic behind JavaScript **type coercion** and equality checks.

## 🔧 Utils

Advanced utility functions and transformation logic — real-world inspired.

- `Call, bind, apply` – Understanding `call`, `bind`, and `apply` is essential for mastering how JavaScript handles function context (`this`). **Often asked on interviews**.
- `Dictionary of Nested` – Deeply nested array structure (e.g., categories → subcategories → items) into a dictionary format for **constant-time lookup** by `id`.
- `Group List by Quarters` – Groups monthly financial data by calendar quarters.
- `Transform Lists and Trees` – List to tree, tree to list, flat nested items.
- `Promises Closures Event Loop` – Async behavior, state retention, and timing execution in complex JavaScript code.
- `Sorting` – bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort.
- `Various Utilities` – clsx, contains duplicate, deep clone, filter by related property, filterMap, innerJoin, Reducer pattern with actions, Retry with exponential backoff, Shuffle (Fisher-Yates Algorithm), Topological Sort.



## About Me

I’m a frontend developer based in Russia, currently working at [Sellego](https://sellego.com/blog/).
I specialize in building modern web apps using **React** on the frontend and **Node.js** on the backend.
