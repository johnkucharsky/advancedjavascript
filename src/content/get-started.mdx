# Advanced JavaScript Code Examples

## About Project

💡 Leetcode problems can sometimes feel disconnected from real-world development ( with a few valuable exceptions: **graph algorithms** and **system design** ).

What truly matters? Understanding how **JavaScript works under the hood**. If you don't understand JavaScript, Leetcode is just a waste of time —
you're solving abstract puzzles without mastering the real engine behind your code. Instead, build your skills with **Advanced JavaScript Patterns**,
carefully selected code snippets, and concepts that companies *actually* expect in interviews.

**Dive in, practice, and develop real confidence.**

> 📌 This resource complements foundational learning platforms like
> [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/), and [react.dev](https://react.dev).
> If you’re just starting out, begin there to build strong fundamentals.

## Content

### 🧭 Graph Algorithms

Fundamental graph traversal logic used in system design and coding challenges.

- [Graph Traversal](/graph-algorithms/graph-traversal) – **BFS**, **DFS**, adjacency lists, graph algorithms.

### 📦 JS Native

Deep dive into native JavaScript methods and behavior. Each section includes polyfills ( custom implementation ),
explanations and all possible use cases.

- [Map](/js-native/map-ds) – Map, WeakMap, Map.groupBy.
- [Mutating Methods](/js-native/mutating-methods) – concat, fill, pop, push, reverse, shift, unshift, splice.
- [Promises](/js-native/promises) – Promise.all, race, any, allSettled.
- [Read methods](/js-native/read-only-methods) – at, every, find, findIndex, findLast, includes, indexOf, some.
- [Set and Object](/js-native/set-and-object) – Set, Object.groupBy, Object.assign, Array.entries.
- [Transform Methods](/js-native/transform-methods) – filter, flat, flatMap, join, map, reduce, slice.

### 📖 Learn JS and Mdn

Essential learning topics pulled from MDN, Learn JS, interviews and my web dev job.

- [Advanced Patterns](/learn-js-and-mdn/advanced-patterns) – Memoize, Mixins, Promise Chaining, Promise Error Handling, Synchronous vs Asynchronous Errors in Promises, Proxy, Range Iterator, Shooters: Closures & Lexical Scope.
- [Delay, Throttling and Debounce](/learn-js-and-mdn/async-and-timers) – Delay Decorator, Delaying function execution, Output Every Second, setInterval, setTimeout, throttling and debounce decorator.
- [Core Concepts](/learn-js-and-mdn/core-concepts) – Understanding this, Loop Behavior: Pre- / Post-Increment, Object and Map Conversion, bind, Async Generators, Fibonacci ( Iterative Approach, Recursive Approach ).
- [Event Loop](/learn-js-and-mdn/event-loop) – Event Loop edge cases — the **#1 most asked JavaScript interview topic**.
- [This and Object Methods](/learn-js-and-mdn/object-methods) – Nuances of `this` across different method contexts — the **#2 most asked JavaScript interview topic**.

### ⚙️ Lodash

Utility functions from [lodash](https://lodash.com/).

- [Chunk, Compact, Partition](/lodash/array-helpers) – chunk, compact, partition.
- [Difference, Intersection, Union](/lodash/difference-and-intersection) – difference, differenceBy, intersection, union.
- [Object Utilities](/lodash/sets-and-objects) – keyBy, omit, orderBy, pick, curry.

### ⚛️ React

React specific topics.

- [React Rendering](/react/rendering) – usePrevious, children.
- [State Patterns](/react/state) – Normalized State, useReducer ( custom implementation ).

### 🧩 System Design

System design concepts often seen in real interviews.

- [Redux and Twitter](/system-design/redux-and-twitter) – Redux reducer pattern, most used pattern for state management in react. Twitter feed pattern.
- [Queue and Stack](/system-design/stack-and-queue) – Stacks and queues are core to how JavaScript works under the hood — and they show up in nearly every interview.

### 🧠 Theory

High-level principles and mental models.

- [Composition vs Inheritance](/theory/composition-vs-inheritance) - Composition, Inheritance and Function Stack.
- [SOLID in React](/theory/solid-react) - SOLID principles in React.
- [Type Conversions](/theory/type-conversions) - Explore the magic behind JavaScript **type coercion** and equality checks.

### 🔧 Various

Advanced utility functions and transformation logic — real-world inspired.

- [Call, bind, apply](/various/call-bind-apply) – Understanding `call`, `bind`, and `apply` is essential for mastering how JavaScript handles function context (`this`). **Often asked on interviews**.
- [Dictionary of Nested](/various/dictionary-of-nested) – Deeply nested array structure (e.g., categories → subcategories → items) into a dictionary format for **constant-time lookup** by `id`.
- [Group List by Quarters](/various/group-list-by-quarters) – Groups monthly financial data by calendar quarters.
- [Transform Lists and Trees](/various/list-to-tree) – List to tree, tree to list, flat nested items.
- [Promises Closures Event Loop](/various/promises-closures-async) – Async behavior, state retention, and timing execution in complex JavaScript code.
- [Sorting](/various/sorting) – bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort.
- [Various Utilities](/various/utils) – clsx, contains duplicate, deep clone, filter by related property, filterMap, innerJoin, Reducer pattern with actions, Retry with exponential backoff, Shuffle (Fisher-Yates Algorithm), Topological Sort.

## About Me

I’m a frontend developer based in Russia, currently working at [Sellego](https://sellego.com/blog/).
I specialize in building modern web apps using **React** on the frontend and **Node.js** on the backend.
