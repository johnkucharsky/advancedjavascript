# 🔄 Promises, Closures and Event Loop Mix

This section demonstrates how **JavaScript promises**, **closures**, and the **event loop** interact in real-world scenarios. These examples cover:

- How closures preserve state across async calls
- What happens when you `await` vs. run multiple async calls in parallel
- The importance of capturing variables in closures before `setTimeout`
- How the event loop schedules tasks with `setTimeout`, `Promise`, and `console.log`
- Sequential chaining of promises with closures

Perfect for understanding async behavior, state retention, and timing execution in complex JavaScript code.

## Async function with closure and delayed execution

This example shows how **closures** capture state (`count`) and how **`await`** affects the execution order.
Each call to `asyncCounter()` increments `count` and logs it immediately. However, `await` delays further code inside the async function,
allowing subsequent calls to update `count` before the first finishes.

- Multiple calls to the same async function share the same closure state.
- `console.log("Script complete")` runs immediately because `await` yields control to the event loop.

```js filename="createAsyncCounter" copy
function createAsyncCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return async function incrementAsyncCounter() {
    count++;
    console.log({ count });
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    console.log("Async Counter:", count);
  };
}

const asyncCounter = createAsyncCounter();

asyncCounter();
asyncCounter().then(() => {
  asyncCounter();
});

console.log("Script complete");

// { count: 1 }
// { count: 2 }
// Script complete
// 1 s delay
// Async Counter: 2
// Async Counter: 2
// { count: 3 }
// 1 s delay
// Async Counter: 3
```

## Sequential async calls with `await` and closure

This example demonstrates how sequential `await` calls work with closures. Each async call completes before the next one begins,
ensuring the counter increments correctly. The `count` variable is preserved across invocations due to the closure, and each `setTimeout`
resolves after 1 second, leading to predictable, step-by-step output.

```js filename="asyncCounter" copy
function createAsyncCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return async function incrementAsyncCounter() {
    count++;
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    console.log("Async Counter:", count);
  };
}

const asyncCounter = createAsyncCounter();

await asyncCounter();
await asyncCounter();
await asyncCounter();

console.log("Script complete");

// with 1s between:
// Async Counter: 1
// Async Counter: 2
// Async Counter: 3
// immediately after counter 3:
// Script complete
```

## Task scheduling with closures and async timing

This example highlights how closure captures the shared `taskCount` variable, which is incremented before each scheduled task.
All tasks reference the same `taskCount` value by the time their `setTimeout` callbacks run, resulting in each log displaying `Task Count: 3`.
It also demonstrates how microtasks (like `Promise.resolve().then`) run before timers and the event loop order between synchronous code, promises, and `setTimeout`.


```js filename="createTaskScheduler" copy
function createTaskScheduler() {
  let taskCount = 0;
  return function scheduleTask() {
    taskCount++;
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Task Count:", taskCount);
    }, taskCount * 1000);
  };
}

const scheduleTask = createTaskScheduler();

scheduleTask();
scheduleTask();

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("promise");
  scheduleTask();
});

console.log("Tasks scheduled");

// Tasks scheduled
// promise
// after 1s with 1s between
// Task Count: 3
// Task Count: 3
// Task Count: 3
```

## Scheduling tasks with preserved state using closures

In this version, the closure captures the `taskCount` value in a separate variable `savedCount` before scheduling the `setTimeout`.
This ensures that each task logs the correct value at the time it was created, rather than referencing the final shared `taskCount`.
The result is that each `setTimeout` logs a different value in increasing order, showcasing how to avoid timing issues by saving state early.

```js filename="createTaskScheduler" copy
function createTaskScheduler() {
  let taskCount = 0;
  return function scheduleTask() {
    taskCount++;
    const savedCount = taskCount;
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Task Count:", savedCount);
    }, taskCount * 1000);
  };
}

const scheduleTask = createTaskScheduler();

scheduleTask();
scheduleTask();

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  scheduleTask();
});

console.log("Tasks scheduled");

// Tasks scheduled
// after 1s with 1s between:
// Task Count: 1
// Task Count: 2
// Task Count: 3
```

## Preserving async state with closure in chained promises

This example demonstrates how closures can maintain and update state (`count`) across multiple asynchronous calls.
Because the promise is chained (`then -> then`), each `counter()` call executes sequentially, allowing `count` to increment between calls.
The use of `setTimeout` inside the promise simulates asynchronous work, and the closure ensures the `count` value is correctly preserved across executions.

```js filename="createCounter" copy
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function incrementCounter() {
    count++;
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(count);
      }, 1000);
    });
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();

// if it was called at the same time, count would
// have not been saved in closure

counter()
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("Counter 1:", result);
    return counter();
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("Counter 2:", result);
  });

console.log("Script in progress");

// Script in progress
// after 1s with 1s between:
// Counter 1: 1
// Counter 2: 2
```

## Asynchronous multiplier using closure and chained promises

This example showcases how closures can maintain internal state (`factor = 2`) in an asynchronous function.
The `multiplyByTwo` function, returned by `createAsyncMultiplier`, remembers the `factor` across multiple chained `.then()` calls.
Each multiplication is delayed with `setTimeout`, and the result of one multiplication is passed to the next, demonstrating sequential asynchronous logic with shared state.

```js filename="createAsyncMultiplier" copy
function createAsyncMultiplier() {
  let factor = 2;

  return function multiply(value) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(value * factor);
      }, 1000);
    });
  };
}

const multiplyByTwo = createAsyncMultiplier();

multiplyByTwo(5)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("Multiply 1:", result);
    return multiplyByTwo(result);
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("Multiply 2:", result);
    return multiplyByTwo(result);
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("Multiply 3:", result);
  });

console.log("Multiplication started");

// Multiplication started
// after 1s with 1s between:
// Multiply 1: 10
// Multiply 2: 20
// Multiply 3: 40
```
