## shooters

Every function is meant to output its number. All `shooter` functions are created in the lexical
environment of `makeArmy()` function. But when `army[5]()` is called, `makeArmy` has already
finished its job, and the final value of `i` is `10` (`while` stops at `i=10`). As the result,
all `shooter` functions get the same value from the outer lexical environment and that is,
the last value, `i=10`. Solution is to save variable `let j = i`

```js filename="lexical environment(scope)" copy
function makeArmy() {
  const shooters = [];

  let i = 0;
  while (i < 10) {
    let j = i; // save local variable
    const shooter = function () {
      // create a shooter function,
      return j; // that should show its number
    };
    shooters.push(shooter); // and add it to the array
    i++;
  }

  // ...and return the array of shooters
  return shooters;
}

const army = makeArmy();

console.log(army[0]()); // 0
console.log(army[1]()); // 1
console.log(army[5]()); // 5
```
