## for and while

This example highlights the subtle differences between `++i` (pre-increment) and `i++` (post-increment) in `while` loops, and how they affect loop behavior and output.

It also compares `for` loops using `i++` vs `++i`, which behave the same in this context, since the increment happens after the loop body executes.

```js filename="for vs while" copy
let i = 0;
while (++i < 3) console.log(i);
// 1, 2

let i2 = 0;
while (i2++ < 3) console.log(i2);
// 1, 2, 3

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) console.log(i);
// 0, 1, 2

for (let i = 0; i < 3; ++i) console.log(i);
// 0, 1, 2
```
