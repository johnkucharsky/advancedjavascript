# Snippets from Real Javascript Interviews

These JavaScript snippets are inspired by **real interview questions** and **actual tasks from my job**.
They're crafted to give you **hands-on experience** with advanced JavaScript concepts that companies truly care about.

I'm a frontend developer who went through **20+ interviews** — and I compiled everything companies were asking.
Each snippet is derived from real-world scenarios. If you're familiar with all these topics, you can thrive at any company,
on any project — and feel confident.

> ✅ **Pro tip:** Copy any snippet, run it, and step through it with a debugger to understand what's going on under the hood.

## 🔍 Do you know the output (not guess)?

### What will this print?

```js filename="Promise Resolution Order" copy
const promise1 = Promise.resolve();
const promise2 = Promise.resolve();

promise1.then(() => console.log(1)).then(() => console.log(2));
promise2.then(() => console.log(3)).then(() => console.log(4));
```

### And how about this?

```js filename="Event Loop" copy
console.log("1");

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("2");

  Promise.resolve().then(function () {
    console.log("3");
  });
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(function () {
  console.log("4");

  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("5");
  }, 0);
});

requestAnimationFrame(function () {
  console.log("7");
});

console.log("6");
```
