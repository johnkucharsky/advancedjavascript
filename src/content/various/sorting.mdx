# JavaScript Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are foundational to understanding performance and logic in computer science. These are 3 fundamental ways to sort an array.

## bubble sort

The [`bubbleSort()`](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_bubblesort.php) function sorts an array by repeatedly stepping through the list,
comparing adjacent items, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.

This custom implementation demonstrates the bubble sort algorithm, where the outer loop ensures that each pass moves the largest element to its
correct position. The process is optimized by checking whether any elements were swapped in the inner loop, allowing the algorithm to break early
if the array is already sorted.

```js filename="bubble sort" copy
function bubbleSort(array) {
  const n = array.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    let swapped = false;

    for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
      if (array[j] > array[j + 1]) {
        [array[j], array[j + 1]] = [array[j + 1], array[j]];
        swapped = true;
      }
    }

    if (!swapped) {
      break;
    }
  }
  return array;
}

const myArray = [7, 3, 9, 12, 11];
const sortedArray = bubbleSort(myArray);
console.log(sortedArray);
// [ 3, 7, 9, 11, 12 ]
```

## insertion sort

The [`insertionSort()`](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_insertionsort.php) function sorts an array by
repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into the correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.
It builds the sorted array one item at a time by comparing the current item to the previous ones.

This custom implementation demonstrates the insertion sort algorithm. For each element, it is compared to the previous ones and
inserted into the correct position, shifting elements as necessary.

```js filename="intersection sort" copy
function insertionSort(array) {
  const n = array.length;

  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    let insertIndex = i;
    const currentValue = array[i];

    for (let j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
      if (array[j] > currentValue) {
        array[j + 1] = array[j];
        insertIndex = j;
      } else {
        break;
      }
    }

    array[insertIndex] = currentValue;
  }
  return array;
}

const myArray = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90, 5];
const sortedArray = insertionSort(myArray);
console.log(sortedArray);
// [ 5, 11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90 ]
```

## selection sort

The [`selectionSort()`](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_selectionsort.php) algorithm sorts an
array by repeatedly finding the smallest element from the unsorted part and swapping it with the element at
the current position. It iterates through the array, and in each iteration, selects the smallest element from
the remaining unsorted portion and moves it to its correct position.

This custom implementation demonstrates the selection sort algorithm by scanning the array for the smallest element
and swapping it to the front, progressively moving through the array.

```js filename="selection sort" copy
const selectionSort = (arr) => {
  const n = arr.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    let minIndex = i;

    for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
        minIndex = j;
      }
    }

    const minValue = arr.splice(minIndex, 1)[0];
    arr.splice(i, 0, minValue);
  }
};

const myArray = [64, 34, 25, 5, 22, 11, 90, 12];
selectionSort(myArray);
console.log(myArray);
// [ 5, 11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90 ]
```
