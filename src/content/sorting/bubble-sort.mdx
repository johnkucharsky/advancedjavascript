## bubble sort

The [`bubbleSort()`](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_bubblesort.php) function sorts an array by repeatedly stepping through the list,
comparing adjacent items, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.

This custom implementation demonstrates the bubble sort algorithm, where the outer loop ensures that each pass moves the largest element to its
correct position. The process is optimized by checking whether any elements were swapped in the inner loop, allowing the algorithm to break early
if the array is already sorted.

```js filename="bubble sort" copy
function bubbleSort(array) {
  const n = array.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    let swapped = false;

    for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
      if (array[j] > array[j + 1]) {
        [array[j], array[j + 1]] = [array[j + 1], array[j]];
        swapped = true;
      }
    }

    if (!swapped) {
      break;
    }
  }
  return array;
}

const myArray = [7, 3, 9, 12, 11];
const sortedArray = bubbleSort(myArray);
console.log(sortedArray);
// [ 3, 7, 9, 11, 12 ]
```
